**Introduction**

This code demonstrates how to list files and directories within a specified
directory path using the `std::fs` module in Rust. It iterates through the
directory entries and prints the path of each file or subdirectory.

**Requirements**

- Rust compiler (version 1.51 or higher recommended)

**Instructions**

1. Save the code as a Rust file (e.g., `list_dir.rs`).
2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory containing the saved file.
3. Run the following command to compile and execute the code:

   ```bash
   rustc list_dir.rs && ./list_dir
   ```

**Explanation**

- **`use std::fs::{self};`** (or `use std::fs::{self, DirEntry};`) imports the entire `fs` module from the standard library, providing access to functions for file system operations. You can choose either import style depending on your preference.
- **`fn main()`** defines the main function, the entry point of the program.
- **`let entries = fs::read_dir("D:/path/to/dir").unwrap();`** attempts to read the directory at the specified path (`"D:/path/to/dir"`). If the directory is not found or an error occurs, the program panics with an error message. The `unwrap()` method propagates any errors encountered during the read operation.
- **`for entry in entries`** iterates over each entry (file or subdirectory) within the read directory.
- **`let entry = entry.unwrap();`** extracts the inner value from the `Result` type returned by iterating over the directory entries. Again, `unwrap()` is used here to propagate any errors.
- **`let path = entry.path();`** obtains the path of the current entry (file or subdirectory).
- **`if path.is_dir()`** checks if the current entry is a directory.
  - **`println!("Directory: {}", path.display());`** If it's a directory, prints the path with a "Directory:" prefix.
- **`else { ... }`** If the entry is not a directory (i.e., a file), the following code executes:
  - **`println!("{}", path.display());`** Prints the path of the file.

**Customization**

- Replace `"D:/path/to/dir"` with the actual path to the directory you want to list.
- You can modify the printing format within the `println!` statements to suit your needs.
